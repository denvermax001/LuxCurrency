## 🔮 **The Magic: Hybrid Input Intelligence**

This is the heart of Luxcurrency.
It doesn’t need strict numbers. It understands **real human financial language** across two worlds:

### 🇮🇳 **Indian Hybrid Inputs**

* lakh
* lakhs
* crore
* Cr
* L
* Indian commas
* Mixed expressions like `1 crore 75 lakh 20k`

### 🇺🇸 **American Hybrid Inputs**

* thousand
* k
* million
* M
* billion
* B
* Decimals
* Comma variations

Luxcurrency **parses, normalizes, detects scale, converts, and returns** the exact equivalent across systems.

It feels like talking to a human who “gets” both cultures.

## 🔥 **Why Luxcurrency Exists**

Because every other converter demands:

* strict numbers
* digits only
* no “crore”, no “million”, no “4.4k”, no “2Cr”

Luxcurrency flips the script.
It adapts to **you**, not the other way around.
